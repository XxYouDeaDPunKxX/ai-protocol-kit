# 🧰✨ ai-protocol-kit

> 🧭 **Choose the right AI working contract before you ask AI to work.**

`ai-protocol-kit` is a collection of practical AI protocols for making AI-assisted work more structured, inspectable, and repeatable. 🛠️🔍♻️

These are not magic prompts. 🪄🚫  
They are **working contracts**: instructions you give to an AI so it knows how to approach a task, what to check, what not to assume, when to stop, and what kind of output is acceptable. 📜✅🛑

The protocols are experimental and shaped from real workflows: rough ideas, repository reviews, README work, GitHub publication, public pages, bug findings, structured outputs, and complex sessions where AI needs stronger rails before it acts. 🧪🧱🌐🤖

## 🚦 Start here: choose by situation

Do **not** pick a protocol by name first. 🧩  
Pick it by the **failure mode you want to prevent**. ⚠️

## 🧭 Protocol map

Some protocols appear in more than one lane because they can play different roles. That is intentional, but stacking is still not the default. 🔁🛑

| Lane | Use when | Protocols |
|---|---|---|
| 🐣 **Shape the work** | The task is ambiguous, premature, overloaded, or underspecified. | 🧩 Idea Shaping · 🔍 Pre-Task Expansion · 🧬 Structural Shaping · 📡 System Reading |
| 🧾 **Brief the artifact** | AI needs a clear brief before writing, building, or structuring output. | 🧱 HTML Page & Tool Briefing · 🗣️ Output for Real Readers |
| 🐞 **Review findings and evidence** | The job is inspection, bugs, uncertainty, evidence, or claim control. | 🐞 Field Findings & Bugs · 📡 System Reading |
| 🧠 **Reasoning, constraints & system reading** | The task needs expansion, system interpretation, or constraint-aware reasoning before output. | 🔍 Pre-Task Expansion · 📡 System Reading · 🌀 PHI-Lens |
| 🐙 **GitHub / public repo & page publishing** | The work touches GitHub, Pages, README, public pages, discovery files, badges, or publication hygiene. | 🚦 Repository Publication · 📝 README Framing · 🧿 Pages Discovery · 📊 Badge/Telemetry · 🌐 Public Page Publication · 🛰️ Website Discovery |
| ⚙️ **Govern agentic sessions** | AI must operate with tools, files, repo state, review loops, or multi-pass control. | ⚙️ Agentic Posture · 🔺 Triad Orchestration |

## 🧪 Minimal stacks

Default rule: use **one protocol**. ☝️  
Stack only when one protocol controls the session and another controls the artifact or publication target. 🧱➕🧭

2. 📝 [GitHub README Framing and Authoring Protocol v2](protocols/github-readme-framing-authoring-protocol-v2.md)
3. 📊 [GitHub Badge, Telemetry & Counter Protocol v1.2.3](protocols/github-badge-telemetry-counter-protocol-v1-2-3.md) only if badges, counters, analytics, or validation checks are actually needed

### 🌐 Prepare a public project page or GitHub Pages surface

1. 🌐 [Public Page Publication Protocol v2](protocols/public-page-publication-protocol-v2.md)
2. 🧱 [HTML Page & Tool Briefing Protocol v2](protocols/html-page-and-tool-briefing-protocol-v2.md) if implementation briefing is needed
3. 🧿 [GitHub Pages Discovery Set Protocol v1](protocols/github-pages-discovery-set-protocol-v1.md) or 🛰️ [HTML and Website Discovery Set Protocol v1.2](protocols/html-and-website-discovery-set-protocol-v1-2.md) before publishing

### 🐞 Review messy findings without losing evidence

1. 🐞 [Field Findings & Bugs Protocol v2](protocols/field-findings-and-bugs-protocol-v2.md)
2. 🌀 [PHI-Lens Protocol v4.a](protocols/phi-lens-protocol-v4-a.md) only if constraints conflict and a flat compromise would be misleading

### 🧠 Reason through a hard, ambiguous, or constraint-heavy task

1. 🔍 [Pre-Task Expansion Protocol v1](protocols/pre-task-expansion-protocol-v1.md) if the task may collapse too quickly into the obvious answer
2. 📡 [System Reading Protocol v0.2](protocols/system-reading-protocol-v0-2.md) if the real system behavior matters more than declared intent
3. 🌀 [PHI-Lens Protocol v4.a](protocols/phi-lens-protocol-v4-a.md) only if constraints interact and the output needs an explicit gate

### ⚙️ Run a complex AI-assisted repo or file session

1. ⚙️ [GPT Agentic Posture Contract](protocols/gpt-agentic-posture-contract.md)
2. 🔺 [Triad AI Orchestration Protocol v3](protocols/triad-ai-orchestration-protocol-v3.md) only if executor/reviewer separation is needed
3. 🐞 [Field Findings & Bugs Protocol v2](protocols/field-findings-and-bugs-protocol-v2.md) if findings must be captured as evidence

## 🧷 How to use a protocol

1. 🎯 Pick the protocol closest to the actual job.
2. 📋 Paste or upload the protocol into the AI context before execution.
3. 📦 Provide the target material: files, repo snapshot, page, README, bug report, idea, or constraints.
4. ✅ Let the protocol control the workflow: questions, gates, review, assumptions, stop conditions, and final output.

Do not stack protocols casually. 🛑  
Use the smallest set that fits the task. 🧘‍♂️

## 🧰 What this is for

Use this kit when you want AI-assisted work to be more: ✨

- 🔍 inspectable
- ♻️ repeatable
- 🧱 structured
- 🧭 constrained
- 🐙 repository-aware
- 🛑 honest about stop conditions
- 📌 explicit about evidence and assumptions

It is useful for practical, messy, non-theoretical situations where the AI should not simply improvise from a vague prompt. 🧪🛠️

---

## 🚫 What this is not

This is not a replacement for judgment. 🧠

These protocols do not guarantee correctness. They reduce common failure modes: rushing to the obvious answer, writing for the wrong reader, inventing unsupported claims, treating chat summaries as repository truth, publishing before review, or letting AI tools approve their own work. ⚠️

They also do not override higher-priority instructions. Safety, legality, privacy, data integrity, and tool limits remain above any protocol in this kit. 🛡️⚖️🔐

---

## 🔧 Repository status

Active working kit. 🧪  
Protocols may evolve as they are tested in real workflows. 🔁

---

## 🤖 AI-assisted development

This project was developed with AI assistance. 🤝🤖

The project, documentation, and repository materials were shaped through human-directed work supported by AI tools during drafting, structuring, review, and refinement. 🧭✍️🔎

AI assistance does not make the project automatically correct, complete, or suitable for every use case. Read it, test it, and adapt it to your own context. 🧪📌
